# Kruskal-Implementation

This Python script generates a random graph with specified nodes and edges, and then applies Kruskal's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree. The code uses the NetworkX library for graph manipulation and Matplotlib for visualization. The generated graph can be dense or sparse based on the "Dense" variable. The script then creates a DataFrame to represent the graph's adjacency matrix, converts it into a dictionary of edges with weights, and applies Kruskal's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree. The resulting minimum spanning tree and the original graph are visualized using NetworkX.
Key Features:

    Random graph generation with customizable density.
    Implementation of Kruskal's algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree.
    Visualization of the original graph and the minimum spanning tree using NetworkX and Matplotlib.
